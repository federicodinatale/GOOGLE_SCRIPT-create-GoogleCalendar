I was running this script where I used to work. 
They sent me the schedule on a Single Page Application with poor frontend taste. 
  
Therefore I decided to creare a script that automatically will create a nicer schedule on my Google Calendar account.
 
When I pasted the schedule from the SPA, the data was not aligned. Thefore I created the functions alignTable() and format() in order to align as follow: 
 
COLUMN A   |  COLUMN B    | COLUMN C   |  COLUMN D
date       |   time start | time end   |   name
